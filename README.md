# H2M-AW-Map-Streak-Replacer
Some killstreaks do not work properly on certain AW maps in H2M - or are so broken they give the player god mode. This script replaces those streaks with other streaks.

## Broken Streaks
### Chopper Gunner / AC-130
On some maps, if you try to use the chopper gunner it will pull out the tablet, fade to black as if it's about to put you in your chopper gunner, but then switch back to your player's perspective. You can switch weapons and get your gun back out. If you die from now on, you will become invisible and invincible until the end of the match or until you reconnect.

On the same maps, if you try to use an AC-130, it will actually put you in your AC-130 but it will not move and will be facing the opposite side of the map so you will not be able to kill anyone.

### Harrier Strike / Pavelow / Helicopter
On some maps, the harrier stays low to the ground or goes underground and will not get any kills. In other cases it seems to be invisible - still getting kills but unable to be shot down.

It seems that on the same maps if you call in a pavelow or a helicopter, nothing happens. I did not test the pavelow and helicopter as extensively as the other streaks. Contact me on Discord (@.co.uk) or make a GitHub issue if I made a mistake.

This map does not seem to work at all on H2M so I was not able to test it.
